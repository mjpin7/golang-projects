## Quiz Game
This project is a very simple quiz game. The program will read in a set of problems/answers from a csv file that can be specified (defaulted to problems.csv), it will then go through and ask the user the questions on a time limit that can also be specified (defaulted to 30s)

## URL Shortener
This project is a very simple URL redirector that will take in the path inserted on the url and redirect it according to created maps/yaml in the program using the http handlers
